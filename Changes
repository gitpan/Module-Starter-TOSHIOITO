Revision history for Module-Starter-TOSHIOITO

0.09    2014-10-12
        - .travis.yml is updated to install Module::Build::Prereqs::FromCPANfile explicitly.
          This is because Travis-CI doesn't have cpanfile-dump command anymore.

0.08    2014-08-17
        - Add "share" directory and "README.md" to no_index.

0.07    2014-08-17
        - Just update the documentation. I forgot it at the previous release..

0.06    2014-08-17
        - Now Build.PL uses Module::Build::Prereqs::FromCPANfile instead of
          Module::Build::Pluggable::CPANfile. The former is a lot lighter
          in terms of dependency.
        - Add an author test to check generated files.
        - .travis.yml is updated to install configure_requires in before_install phase.

0.05    2014-07-28
        - Add "before_script" command to .travis.yml.
          This is because cpanm (as of version 1.7004) does not install configure-requires
          in cpanfile. See also: https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/issues/398
          Current best practice is to generate and keep META files in the repository.
          In that case, cpanm will install configure-requires. But I'm afraid I don't wanna
          keep them around. They are so verbose :(

        - Generates .travis.yml
        - Generates more detailed "repository" meta fields, which is defined
          in Meta Spec version 2.

0.03    2014-02-24
        - Stop generating xt/consistent_version.t.
          It seems it's not the best practice to have consistent version
          across all modules in a distribution. Well, I do think it's good,
          but maintaining version numbers of all modules is an aweful task.
          I've done several approaches (like letting a single module in the
          dist keep the version number), but all of them broke something
          in CPAN. So the only way to keep the consistency intact is to
          let the packager software write version numbers (like
          Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion). However, not all CPAN authors
          are happy with letting software rewrite your code (See
          https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Milla#WHY ), and I don't like it
          either. After all, many famous CPAN authors do not give
          version numbers to all modules in a dist.


0.02    2013-11-21
        - Fix minor POD error.
        - Modules used in xt/ tests are now mandatory. They are installed
          as prerequisites of this module.
        - Now it generates xt/consistent_version.t test using
          Test::ConsistentVersion.

0.01    2013-11-17
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
